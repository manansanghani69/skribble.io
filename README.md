# 🎨 Skribbl Clone - Flutter Mobile App

This repository contains a Flutter-based mobile application that serves as a mobile version of the popular online drawing and guessing game [skribbl.io](https://skribbl.io/). The app leverages `socket.io` for real-time communication and `MongoDB` for persistent data storage.

## 📱 Features

- **Real-Time Drawing and Guessing:** Just like the web version, users can draw and guess in real-time.
- **Multiplayer Support:** Play with friends or other users from around the world.
- **Custom Game Rooms:** Create private rooms to play with specific people.
- **Cross-Platform:** Available on both Android and iOS devices.
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration using MongoDB for data persistence.
- **Leaderboard:** Track the top players in different game rooms.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Flutter:** The app is built using Flutter for a beautiful and responsive user interface.
- **Socket.IO:** Handles real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and server.
- **Node.js:** Backend server to manage game logic and user interactions.
- **Express.js:** Web framework for Node.js to build RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB:** Database to store user information, game data, and leaderboards.
- **Firebase:** Used for authentication and cloud messaging.
